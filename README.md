4. Run menu.pyw and set variables
5. Click run when complete

- The script will start by looking for the "find match" button
- If queue gets dodged or declined, don't do anything. The bot will pick up on it and requeue after a minute so just wait
- You can stop the bot by pressing the '`' key

# Issues you may run into
1. If your name has been flagged, the bot may not work. If the bot doesnt respond after 30 seconds once in game, then this is probably the issue. You will have to change your name to fix this.
2.  If it doesn't click the "find match" button after a fews seconds once the run button is clicked, try changing the client window size and restarting it
